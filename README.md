# Wheel of Steam Games

Wheel of Steam Games is a fun way to solve your crippling indecision of which game to play!

Load your entire steam game library onto a prize wheel and see where it takes you! You have control of what games show up on the wheel and are able to launch them from the program!

## Building

If you want to build this yourself, replace [**this line**](https://github.com/KIPdeKIP/wheel-of-steam-games/blob/master/SteamCommunity.cs#L56) with your Steam API key. Don't have a key yet? You can get one [**here**](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).
